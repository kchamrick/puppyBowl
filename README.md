# PuppyBowl

Welcome to PuppyBowl!
In this assessment, Calliope is back and has you working on a project for our local humane society. 

Based on Calliope's email:

You are working with the humane society to add a mini-game to their website.
The game should allow visitors to see teams of puppies compete in a "puppy bowl".
Someone has already built out the API and some of the front end.

Work with your team to plan and implement using GitHub Project. 

You will be provided with the GitHub link to any existing work that has been done. 
Overall, your job is to build out a functional client side. Request data from the API, then render that data on the front end. The front end should allow the user to: 

- View the roster.
- Observe a player's details.
- Add players to the roster.
- Etc.

All the data you need is available through the API. Your job is to leverage it.

ðŸ““ Pro-Tip: As you work, record the knowledge and skills you are using for this project in your journal. That way, when you give a show-and-tell to future employers, you can highlight the skills this project demonstrates.

Getting Started:
- Review the rubric at the bottom of this page.
- Open up the docs for the the Puppy Bowl API.Links to an external site.
- Review the API to learn about what endpoints are provided, how to access them, and what data they return.
- Fork and clone this starter code.Links to an external site.
- Live serve index.html. The website should be blank!
- Read through the comments of each function in script.js to get a sense of what this website should do once completed. Do not start writing code!
- Read the example test specs in script.test.js for fetchAllPlayers.
- Create a GitHub repository with your team. Each student's site needs to have its own Github Project, with every team member on it.
- Start planning. Begin by translating each rubric criterion into a corresponding ticket. - Then, follow the instructions and overview in the README of the starter code.
Instructions
- In script.test.js, use describe to add test specs for fetchSinglePlayer and addNewPlayer.
- Each describe should contain at least one test.
* (Optional) Write tests for removePlayer as well.
* Hint: How would you test a function with no return value?
- Complete the API functions in script.js so all test cases pass when you run npm test.
- Once all tests pass, complete the rest of the functions in script.js.
- The render functions should change what you see when you live serve index.html.

Submission:
GitHub Link that includes the:
- GitHub Project 
- GitHub Repository containing completed script.js and script.test.js files.
